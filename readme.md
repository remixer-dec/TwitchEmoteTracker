**Twitch Emote Changes Tracker**

Runs on server every interval of time. Tracks new emotes, removed emotes and changed emotes from Twitch.tv (global) and BTTV. After it finds something, it posts change information with pictures to VK and Twitter.   
  
UPD 22.08.19: updated tracker to Twitch v5 API, removed posting scripts (vk/twitter), they're outdated due to other API changes and I'm currently using other ones.
